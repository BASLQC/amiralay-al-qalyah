## Sortie

A Sortie is a campaign where you send your shipgirls to fight in a real war. Unlike the Practice wargame, you will run the risk of sinking your ships if you push them beyond heavy damage.

The sorties are the core of the game and many shipgirls can be earned in this method. However, it requires good strategy and mettle to fight a war when your cute little shipgirls are on the line.

### Constructor

The Sortie is an initializable Class, where you provide it parameters about which world and stage to assault, and with which fleet.

```
class Sortie():
	def __init__(int world, int stage):
		self.world = world
		self.stage = stage 
```

Example Usage:

```

world12 = Deployment.Sortie(1, 2)
```
