Task Scheduler
==============

The robot will be designed to conduct only one task at a time, no multithreading (which is against API rules).

Given this limitation, we will need a way to schedule tasks in order of importance, and send a task up the list if it is more important.

## Daily Tasks

Daily tasks can be preset into the scheduler from a database that is kept in sync with the wiki (using a different system of scraper).

## Construction Tasks

Because of the randomness of construction, the script will focus on building "general" classes and hope to get at least one unit from that class.
