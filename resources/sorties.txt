# General Combat Script 
* Assume fleet has been pre-optimized already
* Save which sortie is currently on, and the stats of the fleet as variables for later use
* Check wiki for formations. Use the best formation for the current fleet
Ex. If using torpedo-heavy fleet, and line ahead is one of the options, use line ahead

# Night Battle
Night battles are continuations of the main battles, so if a ship is heavily damaged during a battle, there's no chance of it being sunk during the night battle. However, there is a possiblity of risking a heavily damaged ship girl furthur.

Kind Admiral:

```
if (current score < enemy score)
{
	retreat
}
else
{
	night battle
}
```

Strategic Admiral:

```
if (current score < enemy score)
{
	retreat
}
else if (risk of losing girls < chance of reward)
{
	night battle
}
else
{
	...
```

# Retreating
Ships are only at risk of sinking if they are heavily damaged at the beginning of a battle. Otherwise, if a ship becomes heavily damaged during a battle, every following shot at it that would normally kill it will miss. So, it's very simple not to lose a ship girl, and only a kuso teitoku would take that kind of risk.

Kind Admiral:

```
if (ship damage >= heavy damage)
{
  retreat
}
else
{
  continue
}
```

Strategic Admiral:

```
if (ship damage >= heavy damage && (risk of losing ship girl < chance of reward))
{
  ...
```
