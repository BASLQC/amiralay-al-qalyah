Main Goals for the program:

0) Unlock all four fleets.
Fleet 1 is unlocked from the start
Fleet 2 is unlocked by A4
Fleet 3 is unlocked by A14
Fleet 4 is unlocked by A16

1) Train 3 CL, 3 CLT, 6-8 DD in stage 1-5 before reaching Admiral level 80. Ensure those ships get their kai 2, or lv 60 if they don't have a kai 2

2) Beat stage 2-4 and go to 3-2 to get Kongo ships
For 2-4, use 4 BB and 2 CV
Anti-sub weapons are important, the daily development for that begins with 1-5, ensure each DD in 1-5 has at least two
When there is enough anti-sub equipment, try to develop planes, especially Reppu, a fighter that needed for air-supremacy. Get about 6
